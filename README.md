![Super Resolution](img/super_res.jpg)

## üéØ Project Objective

This project implements and compares various deep learning models for image super-resolution, focusing on enhancing low-resolution images to create high-quality, detailed outputs. I work with the DIV2K dataset and implement multiple state-of-the-art architectures including RDN and Real-ESRGAN.

## üìù Project Description

### What is Image Super-Resolution?

Image super-resolution is the process of enhancing the resolution of a low-resolution image to create a higher-resolution version with more details and clarity. This technology has numerous applications:

- Medical imaging enhancement
- Surveillance footage improvement
- Digital content restoration
- Mobile device display optimization
- Photography and digital art enhancement

### Models Implemented

1. **RDN (Residual Dense Network)**
   - Features dense connections within residual blocks
   - Global feature fusion
   - Trained with both MSE and SSIM loss functions
   
2. **Real-ESRGAN**
   - Enhanced version of ESRGAN for real-world applications
   - High-order degradation modeling
   - U-Net discriminator with spectral normalization
   - Trained on pure synthetic data

## üî¨ Methods Used
- Single-image super-resolution
- Deep convolutional neural networks
- Residual learning
- Generative adversarial networks

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- BasicSR
- GFPGAN
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## üì• Dataset

This project uses the DIV2K dataset, which contains 1000 2K resolution images:
- 800 training images
- 100 validation images

Each set includes:
- High-resolution original images
- Low-resolution versions (with x4 downscaling)
- Two downscaling tracks: bicubic and unknown degradation

## üèÜ Results

### RDN Model Performance

#### RDN with MSE Loss
- Final Training Loss: 0.009
- Final Validation Loss: 0.008
- Final Training PSNR: 21.50
- Final Validation PSNR: 21.97
- Final Training SSIM: 0.563
- Final Validation SSIM: 0.578

#### RDN with SSIM Loss
- Final Training Loss: 0.307
- Final Validation Loss: 0.310
- Final Training PSNR: 19.55
- Final Validation PSNR: 20.11
- Final Training SSIM: 0.693
- Final Validation SSIM: 0.690

### Analysis
1. MSE Loss model achieves better PSNR values
2. SSIM Loss model produces higher perceptual quality
3. Both models show stable training with consistent improvement
